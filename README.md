The analysis of the [Data Analyst job market in France in November 2022](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roman4891/viz/data_analyst_jobs_november/Dashboard1?publish=yes) is based on job announcements published on several job sites such as *LinkedIn*, *Apec.fr*, *Indeed*, and *Free-Work* during that specific month. A total of 363 job announcements were recorded for analysis. The analysis excludes announcements for internships, freelance positions, and apprenticeships. In cases where the same job announcement was published multiple times within the month, it was treated as a single publication.

Each job announcement was carefully examined to extract essential data regarding job conditions, such as the possibility of remote work, contract duration (short-term or long-term), and salary information. Additionally, requirements for job applications, including experience and skills, as well as the economic sector and geographical location, were also considered. However, some job announcements did not provide all the necessary data. In such instances, certain information, such as required experience, was deduced from the context.

For instance, the explicitly mentioned **professional experience** in the announcements ranged from 0 to 7 years. Therefore, expressions like "beginner," "first successful experience," "novice," "confirmed," "recognized," "important experience," "solid experience," and "we will appreciate your experience" were placed within this experience range using contextual clues.

Regarding **contract types** (CDD/CDI), a conservative approach was applied. If the job offer did not specify the type of contract, it was classified as a fixed-term contract (CDD). However, if a company was clearly seeking an exceptional candidate without mentioning the contract type, the job offer was classified as a permanent contract (CDI).

Regarding **remote/on-site jobs**, partially remote positions were not considered as fully "remote" jobs if relocation was necessary.

All the collected data has been included in the observation records journal, which is stored in an Excel file. Subsequently, the data was analyzed and visualized using **Tableau**.

**The analysis reveals several intriguing insights**. Firstly, the highest demand for Data Analysts in France is observed in the fields of business, marketing, and finance. These domains prioritize strategic vision, decision-making, and forecasting, thus highlighting the need for data-driven professionals. Additionally, the domain of IT consulting demonstrates significant demand for Data Analysts, which aligns with the increased reliance on data analysis services within the aforementioned industries.
Finding a reliable relationship between the proposed salary and requested experience in different economic domains can be challenging due to potential biases. In many cases, the salary amount is not disclosed in job announcements. It is likely that the published salaries represent extreme cases: an employer may intentionally advertise a very high salary to attract top-tier professionals, or they may disclose a lower salary due to specific circumstances or constraints. As a result, these published salaries may not accurately reflect the typical salary range for a given position.
Among the most sought-after skills, the analysis highlights the following key competencies: **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **R**. Proficiency in these tools and programming languages is highly valued in the field of data analysis.
